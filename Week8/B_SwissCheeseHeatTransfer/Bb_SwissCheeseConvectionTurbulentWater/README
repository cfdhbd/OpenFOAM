This is a simple case of STEADY-STATE TURBULENT convective heat transfer from 21 spheres. The solver is buoyantSimpleFoam and snappyHexMesh is used to generate the mesh. The fluid is water (approximated with properties at 20 C), the inlet velocity is 1 m/s, and the sphere diameter is 2 cm, which results in a Reynolds number of approximately 20000.

To execute the case, open a terminal from the case directory and run the Allrun script by typing ./Allrun.

To execute the case in parallel (ONLY IF YOU HAVE 4 CORES AVAILABLE), open a terminal from the case directory and run the Allrunpar script by typing ./Allrunpar.

To post-process the results, open a terminal from the case directory and run paraFoam.

To clear the results, open a terminal from the case directory and run the Allclean script by typing ./Allclean.
